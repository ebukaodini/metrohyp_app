To guarantee the excellence of the METROHYP practical experience we now have created our terms to service for our mutual advantage. If you violate these rules it will mean you’ve broken the terms of service and this may result in termination of your account or contract.

Tasks and concierge requests are non-transferable. You cannot sell or give away tasks on your plan but you are more than free to buy a plan for your friends, family, and loved ones—they’ll love you and so will we. Your METROHYP account is also non-transferable. That means if one person signs up, you cannot transfer ownership of that account to another person.

Any arrangement or attempted contract between customer and associate, in exposure to a service deal, demanding that payment be made outside METROHYP shall constitute a materials breach of the contract and be subjected to cancellation without reimbursement.

Every order or request for a product or service must be submitted to official email, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, or SMS for disbursement of the task. Please, all requests must be sent individually(this means that each or every communicated order or request made with your assistant should contain one, defined, task. You can as well submit multiple tasks at one time. This ensures the fastest possible turn around for each task.

If you ever feel like your service could be better, you can contact us by telephone or email us at support@metrohyp.com.ng, metrohypcom@gmail.com. Agreeing to these terms of service means you understand and agree to keep your tasks within the scope of our business.

There is absolutely no warranty on some of the info and duties, or jobs your Online Assistant wraps up for you. What we will promise is that we’ll do our best to provide the most accurate, most effective information available and we know our Virtual Assistants do this better than anyone else. However, if we give you information or results that are wrong, although we’ll be deeply sorry, you can’t hold us liable for it (or the results) legally or morally — we’re sorry!

We will surely miss you dearly if you leave us but we will hold back the agreed payment of any order or service that has previously been purchased by the user if a request for order or service cancellation is filed by the client. To cancel, just email your assistant or contact our Support Team: team@metrohyp.com.ng and request for order cancellation.

In darker news, we reserve the right to terminate the service of a METROHYP client at any time — for any reason. Should this occur, we will give you a prorated refund at the standard monthly rate for any period for which you have already paid. That means that rarely and under great duress, we may end our relationship with a client for any number of reasons.

By signing up for any of our services, you acknowledge that METROHYP has made substantial investments in recruiting, training and matching skilled METROHYP assistants with each of its members including you and that METROHYP has a legitimate interest in earning a reasonable return on those investments. You also acknowledge that Metrohyp has agreements with METROHYP assistants/Service providers that protect this interest by requiring that METROHYP assistants obtain METROHYP ’s prior written consent before accepting any direct engagement (whether as an employee, consultant, contractor or otherwise) with the METROHYP member to whom they were assigned. Accordingly, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You agree that during your membership and for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of your relationship with METROHYP for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, with or without cause, You shall not directly or indirectly solicit any METROHYP assistant who is assigned to you at that time or who was assigned to you within the six months preceding termination of my relationship with METROHYP to leave his or her employment with METROHYP and to work for you in any engagement directly or indirectly. Should any solicitation by you become a substantial factor resulting in a METROHYP assistant leaving METROHYP and accepting an engagement with you directly or indirectly without METROHYP ’s consent, You agree to pay METROHYP as liquidated damages reasonably calculated to compensate METROHYP for its lost investments and not as a penalty of any kind, a one-time fee equivalent to one year of my monthly METROHYP subscription in effect at the most recent date that the METROHYP assistant had been assigned to me by METROHYP.
